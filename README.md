## How it works

1. This  is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a **Devour it!** button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

4. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
